- PrimeNG is only free for the latest version, afterwards previous versions move to LTS which is paid. So forced to keep up to date.
-- See https://primeng.org/lts

- Could use the PrimeNG Speed Dial component for a simple popout menu or something? On mobile maybe?
- Tree Select could be a richer alternative to plain select for multiple templates, if we go the heirarchy way
-- Org Chart could help in the organizing and creation of the heirarchy
- Would Tree Table be better for our main table?

TODO:
- Update to Angular 17 (need PrimeNG to update first)
-- Try server side rendering
- Reporting functionality to chart and do custom queries of data
-- Instead of directly using charts could leverage ChartModule from PrimeNG
- Update Readme.md once the app is close to done
- Remove old-Utility.js once anything of value has been copied over
- Timezone support for Reminders and general dates?
- Do a proper pass and componentize any elements that need it
- Might be nice to highlight any newly added Thing, especially if there are ones in the future, as sorting by date means it's hard to tell what was added
-- Alternatively do we need an "Update/Create Date" field in thing.ts and we sort under the hood by that?
- Put our revision or version number somewhere on the page?
