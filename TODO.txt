- PrimeNG is only free for the latest version, afterwards previous versions move to LTS which is paid. So forced to keep up to date.
-- See https://primeng.org/lts

- Could use the PrimeNG Speed Dial component for a simple popout menu or something? On mobile maybe?
- Tree Select could be a richer alternative to plain select for multiple templates, if we go the heirarchy way
-- Org Chart could help in the organizing and creation of the heirarchy
- Would Tree Table be better for our main table?
- Wrap our top buttons in a Toolbar?
- Instead of directly using charts could leverage ChartModule from PrimeNG

TODO:
- Update to Angular 17 (need PrimeNG to update first)
-- Try server side rendering
- Do optional reminders if a date is set in the future - load them as a list at the top of the page?
