- PrimeNG is only free for the latest version, afterwards previous versions move to LTS which is paid. So forced to keep up to date.
-- See https://primeng.org/lts

- Tree Select could be a richer alternative to plain select for multiple templates, if we go the heirarchy way
-- Org Chart could help in the organizing and creation of the heirarchy
- Would Tree Table be better for our main table?

MAIN FEATURES:
- Update to Angular 17 (need PrimeNG to update first https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/14063)
-- Try server side rendering
-- Try signals and NgRx data store for sharing between parts of app

- Single "Pinned" Template that puts a button on the toolbar and you can quick fill, basically 1 click
-- Likely just confirmPopup, auto-set date to current time, and only a single text field
--- For something repetitive we don't want to have to keep entering like Reminder / Work Commute, etc.

- Reports with custom queries to generate, as well as charts (could be using ChartModule from PrimeNG)

- User login, tokens for API, plus settings

- Eventually do lazy loading on pagination, for large amounts of records
-- Or dropdown of timeframe to pull data from - always simpler and cleaner in regards to sort/filter/etc.
-- Could segment JSON our files by Year, to trim down the total number of records fetched, then have a dropdown of each year that will work against the relevant file
--- Mostly also to stop write/updates from slowing down once you're at 10,000+ records in a single file
--- Similarly should do monthly/yearly backups of our data files automatically on the backend

- Better and more consistent and centralized logging, with levels depending on deployment/environment

- Do a proper pass and componentize any elements that need it
-- Such as menu dial, including it's drag and drop features, table itself maybe?

TODO:
- Update Readme.md once the app is close to done
- Remove old-Utility.js once anything of value has been copied over
- Timezone support for Reminders and general dates? Only necessary if we foresee acting on the server from a client in a different timezone
- Might be nice to highlight any newly added Thing, especially if there are ones in the future, as sorting by date means it's hard to tell what was added
-- Alternatively do we need an "Update/Create Date" field in thing.ts and we sort under the hood by that?
- Put our revision or version number somewhere on the page? Pulled from environment file automatically?
- Detect browser resume on mobile devices
- "Demo mode" (once we have user login) that lets you explore the app without changing data, with a free/auto account, and a bunch of default stuff. Could swap Storage Service for this case?
- Manage tabIndex focus order, especially for mobile
- Would be nice to not have to manually set `tooltipPosition="left"` (or bottom) in cases where the tooltip is smooshed along the right edge. Seems to autocalculate for some but not all
-- File a bug with PrimeNG?
- Tweak loading states so the entire table doesn't disappear while fetching
- Eventually have Photo as a type to upload images to Things
- Look at date-fns (currently used) vs Day.js vs Luxon, consider bundle size and features used
- Where does Inter-roman and Inter-italic font come from? PrimeNG? Slightly big size
- Have a "looking back" / "remember this?" feature that shows you memories from the same time X months/years ago, sort of like Facebook. Toggleable option of course
- Have an "annual repeat" feature for reminders, likely don't want more granular as we're not intending to be a full scheduling app
