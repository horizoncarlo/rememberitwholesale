MAIN FEATURES:
BLOCK- User login, tokens for API, plus settings/profile page

BLOCK- Validation across the app - from 'required' custom fields to dialogs, to checks before saving/using the backend, etc.

- Better and more consistent and centralized logging, with levels depending on deployment/environment

- Do a proper pass and componentize any elements that need it
-- Also make sure existing components are "standalone: true" where possible
-- Such as menu dial, including it's drag and drop features, table itself maybe?

- Reports with custom queries to generate, as well as charts (could be using ChartModule from PrimeNG)

TODO:
- Try signals and NgRx data store for sharing between parts of app using Ang 17
- Update Readme.md once the app is close to done
- Remove old-Utility.js once anything of value has been copied over
- Timezone support for Reminders and general dates? Only necessary if we foresee acting on the server from a client in a different timezone
- Put our revision or version number somewhere on the page? Pulled from environment file automatically?
- Detect browser resume on mobile devices
- "Demo mode" (once we have user login) that lets you explore the app without changing data, with a free/auto account, and a bunch of default stuff. Could swap Storage Service for this case?
- Manage tabIndex focus order, especially for mobile (so for example we can press Next, Next, Go on the floating keyboard)
- Eventually have Photo as a type to upload images to Things
- Have a "looking back" / "remember this?" feature that shows you memories from the same time X months/years ago, sort of like Facebook. Toggleable option of course
- Have an "annual repeat" feature for reminders, likely don't want more granular as we're not intending to be a full scheduling app
- Autosort template dropdown (when adding a new Thing) by grouped select items of Regularly Used, less frequent, etc.
- Try Bun.js as a drop in replacement for Node?
- Eventually segment data files by year? To prevent giant files of 10k+ records? Then date limit filter could integrate with that (by having like 2021, 2022, etc. instead of "2 years ago")

LOADING:
- Block entire page, header and all, with a spinner in the middle (after a couple seconds, to prevent flashing)
-- This is while we're getting the user settings and so on
^-- "isInitialized"

- Progress bar should always show, for ALL loading
-- Maybe a general "has any loading" feature that combines our various rxjs to one result?

- Has a per-service init & loading flags: things for refresh button, templates for Manage X Templates, etc.
-- tableLoading ties to this (blocks main table, but keeps header, equivalent to current things.loading)
- Each service registers themselves in loadingService

- Should also disable or use the "loading" attribute of a lot of buttons we want to avoid exposing while something is happening

- Have specific utility calls, like "top right spinner on/off", that hide the logic in the loading service itself

PRIMENG BUGS:
- Would be nice to not have to manually set `tooltipPosition="left"` (or bottom) in cases where the tooltip is smooshed along the right edge. Seems to autocalculate for some but not all
- Speed Dial has an overlay that extends below the visible button by 44px
*- FILED - they marked WONTFIX: https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/14330
-- Inspect around the Speed Dial to see
-- This blocks the Selected Rows clear button when a reminder is present (as the table gets pushed down and becomes below the overlay)
-- A hacky solution could be to move the dial down when the Reminders are shown, but the view would jump and it's a lot of math if we have multiple reminders

- PrimeNG is only free for the latest version, afterwards previous versions move to LTS which is paid. So forced to keep up to date.
